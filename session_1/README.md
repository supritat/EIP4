1. Convolution: Running a filter/kernel over the image to extract key features.
2. Filters/Kernels: These are feature extractors. Filters can extract edges, gradients, textures, patterns, parts of objects.
3. Epochs: Each iteration/loop run on entire dataset is called one Epoch. Number of iterations on dataset can be called Epochs. 
4. 1x1 Convolution: This filter is used to reduce the number of channels of given Image.
5. 3x3 Convolution: This is filter/kernal. Used as feature extractor. 
6. Feature Maps: Collection of all the channels.
7. Activation Function:
8. Receptive Field: It is the last layer of convoluted data that has (complex)data of image(calculated by convolution).
